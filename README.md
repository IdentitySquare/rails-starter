# System Requirements

* Ruby 3.2.2
* Node.js v18
* Bundler - `gem install bundler`

Homebrew dependencies:
* Redis - For ActionCable, Sidekiq, caching, etc.
* PostgreSQL - For database
* Overmind - For running Procfile processes
* Libvips or ImageMagick - For ActiveStorage image processing

All Homebrew dependencies are listed in `Brewfile`, so you can install them all at once like this:

```bash
brew bundle install --no-upgrade
```

Then you can start the database servers:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
brew services start redis
```
