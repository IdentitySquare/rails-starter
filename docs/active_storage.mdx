# ActiveStorage and Cloudflare R2 Buckets

Enable file uploads by setting `ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD` in the constants file and comment in the gems for this in the Gemfile.

Cloudflare R2 buckets are used in this Rails application for two main purposes:

### File Uploads

The application uses ActiveStorage for file uploads. In the production environment, these files are stored in a bucket. This is configured in [config/storage.yml](https://github.com/danielpaul/RapidRails/blob/main/config/storage.yml).

### Sitemap Storage

The application generates a sitemap for SEO purposes. In the production environment, this sitemap is stored in a bucket. This is configured in [config/sitemap.rb](https://github.com/danielpaul/RapidRails/blob/main/config/sitemap.rb).

## Setting up an Cloudflare R2 Bucket

Follow the instructions on [this page](https://kirillplatonov.com/posts/activestorage-cloudflare-r2/) to set up a Cloudflare R2 bucket.

Create two buckets:
1. Private bucket for file uploads that are accessed with presigned URLs.
2. Public bucket for the sitemap.

Update the secrets on the credentials file.

NOTE: ENABLE_FILE_UPLOAD must be set to true in the constants file for file uploads to work. Also enable the required gems in the Gemfile.
