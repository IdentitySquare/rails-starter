# JavaScript

RapidRails leverages modern JS libraries and frameworks such as [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) as well as Rails Importmaps. Here's a brief overview of how each is used:

## Importmaps

Importmaps allow us to control how JavaScript modules are imported in our application. In this project, the configuration for import maps is found in [config/importmap.rb](https://github.com/danielpaul/RapidRails/blob/main/config/importmap.rb). This file contains the mapping of module specifiers to URLs. To find out more see the [importmaps Rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html#import-maps).

## Alpine.js

Alpine.js is a minimal JavaScript framework used for adding interactivity to the website. For example, Alpine is used in the [HeaderComponent](https://github.com/danielpaul/RapidRails/blob/main/app/views/components/landing_page/header_component.rb) to open and close the dropdown menu. Alpine is preferred for simple interactivity such as this because we can avoid creating various Stimulus controllers.
To find out more see the [Alpine Docs](https://alpinejs.dev/start-here).

## Hotwire

Hotwire is a set of tools (Turbo, Stimulus) from Basecamp for building modern web applications without much JavaScript. To find out more see the [Hotwire Docs](https://hotwired.dev/).
