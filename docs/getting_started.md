2. Click the **Use this template** button and select **Create a new repository**.

4. Clone the repository to your local machine.

5. Navigate to the repository on your terminal and run `bin/setup`.

6. Follow the prompts from the setup script to configure your application. You can read more about the setup script and configuration in the next section.

7. Then simply start your server by running `bin/dev`. 
    
    And... thats it! You're all set to go! ðŸŽ‰
